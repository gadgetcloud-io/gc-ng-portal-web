### Pro Tips for Managing Limits

**Device Limit Tips**:
- Review your devices regularly and remove ones you've sold or no longer own
- Combine similar devices (e.g., multiple old phones → keep only current phone)
- Archive rarely-used devices instead of tracking them actively

**Storage Limit Tips**:
- Delete duplicate photos or receipts
- Keep only essential documents (warranty papers, important receipts)
- Download large files (like manuals) before deleting to keep a local copy
- Compress images before uploading (use "Medium" quality instead of "High")
- Upload only clear, readable receipts (delete blurry photos)
